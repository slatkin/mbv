## Names are free of weasel words (M-WEASEL-WORDS) { #M-WEASEL-WORDS }

<why>readability.</why>

Symbol names, especially type and trait names, should be free of weasel words that do not meaningfully
add information. Common offenders include `Service`, `Manager`, and `Factory`.

While your library may very well contain or communicate with a booking service&mdash;or even hold an `HttpClient`
instance named `booking_service`&mdash;one should rarely encounter a `BookingService` _type_ in code.

An item handling many bookings can just be called `Bookings`. If it does anything more specific, then that quality
should be appended instead. It submits these items elsewhere? Calling it `BookingDispatcher` would be more helpful.

The same is true for `Manager`s. All code manages _something_, so that moniker is rarely useful. With rare
exceptions, life cycle issues should likewise not be made the subject of some manager. Items are created in whatever
way they are needed, their disposal is governed by `Drop`, and only `Drop`.

Regarding factories, at least the term should be avoided. While the concept `FooFactory` has its use, its canonical
Rust name is `Builder` (compare [M-INIT-BUILDER](../libs/ux/#M-INIT-BUILDER)). A builder that can produce items repeatedly is still a builder.

In addition, accepting factories (builders) as parameters is an unidiomatic import of OO concepts into Rust. If
repeatable instantiation is required, functions should ask for an `impl Fn() -> Foo` over a `FooBuilder` or
similar. In contrast, standalone builders have their use, but primarily to reduce parametric permutation complexity
around optional values (again, [M-INIT-BUILDER](../libs/ux/#M-INIT-BUILDER)).
