## Prefer types over generics, generics over dyn traits (M-DI-HIERARCHY) { #M-DI-HIERARCHY }

<why>composable patterns and freedom from design lock-in.</why>

When asking for async dependencies, prefer concrete types over generics, and generics over `dyn Trait`.

It is easy to accidentally deviate from this pattern when porting code from languages like C# that heavily rely on interfaces.
Consider you are porting a service called `Database` from C# to Rust and, inspired by the original `IDatabase` interface, you naively translate it into:

```rust,ignore
trait Database {
    async fn update_config(&self, file: PathBuf);
    async fn store_object(&self, id: Id, obj: Object);
    async fn load_object(&self, id: Id) -> Object;
}

impl Database for MyDatabase { ... }

// Intended to be used like this:
async fn start_service(b: Rc<dyn Database>) { ... }
```

Apart from not feeling idiomatic, this approach precludes other Rust constructs that conflict with object safety,
can cause issues with asynchronous code, and exposes wrappers (compare [M-AVOID-WRAPPERS]).

Instead, when more than one implementation is needed, this _design escalation ladder_ should be followed:

If the other implementation is only concerned with providing a _sans-io_ implementation for testing, implement your type as an
enum, following [M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS] instead.

If users are expected to provide custom implementations, you should introduce one or more traits, and implement them for your own types
_on top_ of your inherent functions. Each trait should be relatively narrow, e.g., `StoreObject`, `LoadObject`. If eventually a single
trait is needed it should be made a subtrait, e.g., `trait DataAccess: StoreObject + LoadObject {}`.

Code working with these traits should ideally accept them as generic type parameters as long as their use does not contribute to significant nesting
(compare [M-ABSTRACTIONS-DONT-NEST]).

```rust,ignore
// Good, generic does not have infectious impact, uses only most specific trait
async fn read_database(x: impl LoadObject) { ... }

// Acceptable, unless further nesting makes this excessive.
struct MyService<T: DataAccess> {
    db: T,
}
```

Once generics become a nesting problem, `dyn Trait` can be considered. Even in this case, visible wrapping should be avoided, and custom wrappers should be preferred.

```rust
# use std::sync::Arc;
# trait DataAccess {
#     fn foo(&self);
# }
// This allows you to expand or change `DynamicDataAccess` later. You can also
// implement `DataAccess` for `DynamicDataAccess` if needed, and use it with
// regular generic functions.
struct DynamicDataAccess(Arc<dyn DataAccess>);

impl DynamicDataAccess {
    fn new<T: DataAccess + 'static>(db: T) -> Self {
        Self(Arc::new(db))
    }
}

struct MyService {
    db: DynamicDataAccess,
}
```

The generic wrapper can also be combined with the enum approach from [M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS]:

```rust,ignore
enum DataAccess {
    MyDatabase(MyDatabase),
    Mock(mock::MockCtrl),
    Dynamic(DynamicDataAccess)
}

async fn read_database(x: &DataAccess) { ... }
```
