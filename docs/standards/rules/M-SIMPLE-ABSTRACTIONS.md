## Abstractions don't visibly nest (M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS) { #M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS }

<why>low cognitive load and a good out-of-the-box UX.</why>

When designing your public types and primary API surface, avoid exposing nested or complex parametrized types to your users.

While powerful, type parameters introduce a cognitive load, even more so if the involved traits are crate-specific. Type parameters
become infectious to user code holding on to these types in their fields, often come with complex trait hierarchies on their own, and
might cause confusing error messages.

From the perspective of a user authoring `Foo`, where the other structs come from your crate:

```rust,ignore
struct Foo {
    service: Service // Great
    service: Service<Backend> // Acceptable
    service: Service<Backend<Store>> // Bad

    list: List<Rc<u32>> // Great, `List<T>` is simple container,
                        // other types user provided.

    matrix: Matrix4x4 // Great
    matrix: Matrix4x4<f32> // Still ok
    matrix: Matrix<f32, Const<4>, Const<4>, ArrayStorage<f32, 4, 4>> // ?!?
}
```

_Visible_ type parameters should be avoided in _service-like_ types (i.e., types mainly instantiated once per thread / application that are often passed
as dependencies), in particular if the nestee originates from the same crate as the service.

Containers, smart-pointers and similar data structures obviously must expose a type parameter, e.g., `List<T>` above. Even then, care should
be taken to limit the number and nesting of parameters.

To decide whether type parameter nesting should be avoided, consider these factors:

- Will the type be **named** by your users?
  - Service-level types are always expected to be named (e.g., `Library<T>`),
  - Utility types, such as the many [`std::iter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/index.html) types like `Chain`, `Cloned`, `Cycle`, are not
    expected to be named.
- Does the type primarily compose with non-user types?
- Do the used type parameters have complex bounds?
- Do the used type parameters affect inference in other types or functions?

The more of these factors apply, the bigger the cognitive burden.

As a rule of thumb, primary service API types should not nest _on their own volition_, and if they do, only 1 level deep. In other words, these
APIs should not require users having to deal with an `Foo<Bar<FooBar>>`. However, if `Foo<T>` users want to bring their own `A<B<C>>` as `T` they
should be free to do so.
