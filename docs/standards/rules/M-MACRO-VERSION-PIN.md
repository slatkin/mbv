## Pin supporting proc macro crates (M-MACRO-VERSION-PIN) { #M-MACRO-VERSION-PIN }

<why>keep generated code compatible with its library</why>

A crate that re-exports macros from companion proc macro crates must pin them to its own exact
version via `=x.y.z`, and each macro crate must pin its own companion crates the same way. When
publishing, those crates are counted as one crate and must be published together with the same
exact version.

Without exact pins, a newer macro may generate code incompatible with an older version of the
crate, causing unexpected and hard-to-diagnose compilation failures in the generated code.

M-MACRO-VERSION-PIN does not apply to independently consumed macro libraries.

Example:

```toml
# foo/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
foo_macros = "=1.2.3"
```
