## Identify, profile, optimize the hot path early (M-HOTPATH) { #M-HOTPATH }

<why>high-performance code.</why>

You should, early in the development process, identify if your crate is performance or COGS relevant. If it is:

- identify hot paths and create benchmarks around them,
- regularly run a profiler collecting CPU and allocation insights,
- document or communicate the most performance sensitive areas.

For benchmarks we recommend [criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion) or [divan](https://crates.io/crates/divan).
If possible, benchmarks should not only measure elapsed wall time, but also used CPU time over all threads (this unfortunately
requires manual work and is not supported out of the box by the common benchmark utils).

Profiling Rust on Windows works out of the box with [Intel VTune](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/vtune-profiler.html)
and [Superluminal](https://superluminal.eu/). However, to gain meaningful CPU insights you should enable debug symbols for benchmarks in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[profile.bench]
debug = 1
```

Documenting the most performance sensitive areas helps other contributors take better decision. This can be as simple as
sharing screenshots of your latest profiling hot spots.

> Some of the most common 'language related' issues we have seen include:
>
> - frequent re-allocations, esp. cloned, growing or `format!` assembled strings,
> - short lived allocations over bump allocations or similar,
> - memory copy overhead that comes from cloning Strings and collections,
> - repeated re-hashing of equal data structures
> - the use of Rust's default hasher where collision resistance wasn't an issue

> Anecdotally, we have seen ~15% benchmark gains on hot paths where only some of these `String`  problems were
> addressed, and it appears that up to 50% could be achieved in highly optimized versions.
