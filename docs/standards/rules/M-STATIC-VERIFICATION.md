## Use static verification (M-STATIC-VERIFICATION) { #M-STATIC-VERIFICATION }

<why>consistency and freedom from common issues.</why>

Projects should use the following static verification tools to help maintain the quality of the code. These tools can be
configured to run on a developer's machine during normal work, and should be used as part of check-in gates.

* [compiler lints](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/index.html) offer many lints to avoid bugs and improve code quality.
* [clippy lints](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/) contain hundreds of lints to avoid bugs and improve code quality.
* [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) ensures consistent source formatting.
* [cargo-audit](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit) verifies crate dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
* [cargo-hack](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-hack) validates that all combinations of crate features work correctly.
* [cargo-udeps](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-udeps) detects unused dependencies in Cargo.toml files.
* [miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) validates the correctness of unsafe code.

### Compiler Lints

The Rust compiler generally produces exceptionally good diagnostics. In addition to the default set of diagnostics, projects
should explicitly enable the following set of compiler lints:

```toml
[lints.rust]
ambiguous_negative_literals = "warn"
missing_debug_implementations = "warn"
redundant_imports = "warn"
redundant_lifetimes = "warn"
trivial_numeric_casts = "warn"
unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn = "warn"
unused_lifetimes = "warn"
```

### Clippy Lints

For clippy, projects should enable all major lint categories, and additionally enable some lints from the `restriction` lint group.
Undesired lints (e.g., numeric casts) can be opted back out of on a case-by-case basis:

```toml
[lints.clippy]
cargo = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
complexity = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
correctness = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
pedantic = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
perf = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
style = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
suspicious = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
# nursery = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }  # optional, might cause more false positives

# Additional lints are from the `restriction` and `nursery` group that prevent specific
# constructs being used in source code in order to drive up consistency,
# quality, and brevity
allow_attributes_without_reason = "warn"
as_pointer_underscore = "warn"
assertions_on_result_states = "warn"
clone_on_ref_ptr = "warn"
deref_by_slicing = "warn"
disallowed_script_idents = "warn"
empty_drop = "warn"
empty_enum_variants_with_brackets = "warn"
empty_structs_with_brackets = "warn"
fn_to_numeric_cast_any = "warn"
if_then_some_else_none = "warn"
map_err_ignore = "warn"
redundant_type_annotations = "warn"
renamed_function_params = "warn"
semicolon_outside_block = "warn"
undocumented_unsafe_blocks = "warn"
unnecessary_safety_comment = "warn"
unnecessary_safety_doc = "warn"
unneeded_field_pattern = "warn"
unused_result_ok = "warn"
too_long_first_doc_paragraph = "warn"

# May cause issues with structured logging otherwise.
literal_string_with_formatting_args = "allow"

# Define custom opt outs here
# ...
```
