## Macros don't lie about signatures (M-MACROS-DONT-LIE) { #M-MACROS-DONT-LIE }

<why>clarity for users and LLMs.</why>

Macros must not (make users) misrepresent signatures or the shape of items.

Macros have the ability to arbitrarily rewrite token streams. They could convert structs to enums, traits to functions, or perform any other transformation imaginable. They should, however, do none of that, as the resulting code will be highly confusing and virtually impossible to predict or reason about.

Among others, macros must not

- visibly convert the nature of data types (e.g., structs to enums, ...),
- alter function signatures,
- convert the `async`-ness of items,
- do anything else that materially detaches _what's written_ from _what's happening_.

```rust,ignore
// Bad: Adds extra parameter and marks function `async`. Impossible to 
// predict from reading code. 
#[magic_transform]
fn foo() { }

foo(token).await
```
