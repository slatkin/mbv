## Hot `async` functions reduce stack size (M-ASYNC-STACK-SIZE) { #M-ASYNC-STACK-SIZE }

<why>small async stack sizes and low memcpy overhead.</why>

Functions marked `async` in the hot path should track their future sizes, and take one or more of the following steps to reduce their impact:

- reduction of parameter and rval type size,
- reduction of type size of items held across `.await` points,
- returning `impl Future` and extracting setup logic from `async {}` capture.

> Regular locals, that only live momentarily between two `.await` points, still remain part of the runtime thread's regular stack. However, any locals that live across `.await` points, or parameters passed during construction, become part of that Future's state machine type, and the layout of this type is currently not as optimized as it could be.

>                                 // blowing up its size, despite it not even
>                                 // being used.

For many async functions this isn't an issue, as their associated `Future`-cost is negligible. However, functions used along the hot path, that are either called or instantiated frequently (e.g., 1000's of calls per second or concurrent tasks) might benefit from monitoring and optimizations.

Hot futures should be tracked via `size_of_val`:

```rust,ignore
async fn hot() { ... }

#[test]
fn has_reasonable_size() {
    let f = hot();
    assert!(size_of_val(&f) < ...); // Determine value / limit at first run.
}
```

Then consider a combination of the following:

```rust,ignore
// 1) Return an `impl Future` instead, this prevents large arguments 
//    from infecting the future size, among others.
fn hot(args: Args) -> impl Future<Output = Result<T>> { 
    // 2) Process arguments outside async context if processing does
    //    not require async functionality.
    let args = args.do_something(); 

    if args.invalid() {
        // 3) Use `Either` to return a single `impl Future` type, as
        //    otherwise you'd have to invent a new type. 
        async { Err(InvalidArgs) }.left_future() 
    } else {
        // 4) Chain future invocations via future helpers, which again 
        //    prevents heavy locals from being passed through the state 
        //    machine.
        read(args).then(|x| foo(x)).right_future() 
    }
}
```
