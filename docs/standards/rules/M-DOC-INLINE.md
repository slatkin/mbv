## Mark `pub use` items with `#[doc(inline)]` (M-DOC-INLINE) { #M-DOC-INLINE }

<why>re-exported items that fit in with their siblings.</why>

When publicly re-exporting crate items via `pub use foo::Foo` or `pub use foo::*`, they show up in an opaque re-export block. In most cases, this is not
helpful to the reader:

Instead, you should annotate them with `#[doc(inline)]` at the `use` site, for them to be inlined organically:

```rust,edition2021,ignore
# pub(crate) mod foo { pub struct Foo; }
#[doc(inline)]
pub use foo::*;

// or

#[doc(inline)]
pub use foo::Foo;
```

This does not apply to `std` or 3rd party types; these should always be re-exported without inlining to make it clear they are external.

> ### <alert></alert> Still avoid glob exports

> The `#[doc(inline)]` trick above does not change [M-NO-GLOB-REEXPORTS]; you generally should not re-export items via wildcards.
