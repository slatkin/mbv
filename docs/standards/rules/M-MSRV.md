## MSRV is conservatively updated (M-MSRV) { #M-MSRV }

<why>modern features with stability for users.</why>

A Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) should be set when libraries are first created. It can be updated as new Rust features are needed, but should be kept a few versions behind the most recent compiler release.

The ecosystem expectation is that projects are compiled with a _reasonably modern_ Rust compiler.

Bumping MSRV therefore does not require a major release, but can be handled through a minor update (e.g., `1.3` to `1.4`). In fact, any project depending on 3rd party crates is already inherently bound to this contract; forcing a major version bump will not confer any benefits, but could possibly bifurcate downstream dependencies.
